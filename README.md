  ## About Me
  #### I’m Kiho Lee, a frontend developer 🧑‍💻 who believes that a good UI is like a good joke — if you have to explain it, it’s not that good. 😎
  #### I studied Computer Science at Concordia University 🎓, where I learned that missing a semicolon can break hearts 💔 (and apps).
  #### By day, I write code that brings pixels to life 🎨✨ — and by night, I occasionally argue with CSS like it owes me money. 💢🧷
  #### Let’s build the web, one bug fix (and coffee ☕️) at a time. 🚀🐛
